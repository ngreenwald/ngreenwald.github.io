<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Biophysics from Harvard University. I then worked at the Broad Institute analyzing DNA sequencing data to identify the genomic drivers that separate low-grade and high-grade brain cancers. Following my work at the Broad, I received my Ph.D in Cancer Biology from Stanford University, where I was co-advised by Mike Angelo and Christina Curtis. While at Stanford, I developed machine learning tools to profile highly-multiplexed imaging data. I then used these tools to characterize the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer patient samples, combining this spatial information with paired DNA and RNA sequencing data to predict patient response to immunotherapy. I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF advised by Willow Coyote-Maestas. In the Coyote-Maestas lab, I am using deep mutational scanning to understand the cross talk between cancer and immune cells. </p>
