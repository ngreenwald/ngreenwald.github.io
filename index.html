<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I'm a PhD student in the Cancer Biology PhD program at Stanford University. I'm co-adivsed by Michael Angelo and Christina Curtis. My PhD work is divided into two parts. The first is the development of novel algorithms for the analysis and intepretation of multiplexed imaging data. The second is the integration of multiplexed imaging and -omics techniques to understand the evolution of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer.  </p>
